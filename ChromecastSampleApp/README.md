# Chromecast Sample App
This project contains a sample sender application for Android that runs a working version of the sender component of the Ooyala Chromecast Integration.

See [http://support.ooyala.com/developers/documentation/tasks/android_cast_sample_app.html](http://support.ooyala.com/developers/documentation/tasks/android_cast_sample_app.html) for documentation that explains how to get started with this sample application.

This application should not be used for testing or evaluating Ooyala SDK capabilities.

## Caveats
* Some of the assets are not playing on our receiver app. We are working on fixing this issues on the receiver app.
